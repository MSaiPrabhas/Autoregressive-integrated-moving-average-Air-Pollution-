Air Pollution Levels Prediction methods using ARIMA Model 

Everything that surrounds us makes up the environment. Due to human activity and natural disasters, the 
environment is becoming increasingly contaminated; Perhaps the most dangerous among these is air 
pollution. 
The climatic variables the concentration of air pollutants in ambient air is controlled by factors such as 
atmospheric wind velocity, wind patterns, relative humidity, and temperature. We experience significantly 
greater heat because sweat doesn't evaporate into the air when the humidity is higher. 
One of the biggest sources of air pollution is urbanization, which increases the quantity of transportation 
infrastructure, releasing more toxins into the environment. Another major source of air pollution is 
industrialization. Steps must be taken to decrease environmental air pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a 
tool for measuring air quality. Previously, air quality was forecast using traditional approaches such as 
probability and statistics; nonetheless, such techniques are still highly effective in prediction.

There are currently many prediction models like AIRMA for future tend prediction and calculating the model's 
precision. We can use ARIMA and predict the future values of a particular particle. There are also many sensors 
installed across the nation to capture the particle levels present in the air which are uploading the data into 
servers very frequently for the study.
